Portfolio Website, 01-2025, Lydia created this portfolio website with the skills she learned in Dr. Angela Yu's Udemy class, 100 Days of Python: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. She used the day 71 files as well as the Finexo Free CSS Template from Free-CSS.com as a starting point for her website, and from there included her own content, made styling edits, and checked her work for both sustainable web design errors and accessibility errors. Once the website was approximately 75% completed, she took on the challenge of getting the website online. Thanks to pythonanywhere, this website is proudly running on sustainable energy, as verified through websitecarbon.com and thegreenwebfoundation.org., https://app.greenweb.org/api/v3/greencheckimage/lydiak22.pythonanywhere.com?nocache=true, C:\Users\lydia\Documents\PythonProjects\PortfolioWebsite, https://github.com/lydsk22/PortfolioWebsite
