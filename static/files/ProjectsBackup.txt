Portfolio Website,, Web Design & Development, Jan-2025, Lydia created this portfolio website with the skills she learned in Dr. Angela Yu's Udemy class, 100 Days of Python: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. She used the day 71 files as well as the Finexo Free CSS Template from Free-CSS.com as a starting point for her website. From there she added her own content including her resume and completed projects. She also has made styling edits and plans to check her work for both sustainable web design errors and accessibility errors. Once the website was approximately 75% completed, she took on the challenge of getting the website online. Thanks to pythonanywhere, this website is proudly running on sustainable energy, as verified through websitecarbon.com and thegreenwebfoundation.org. Projects are loaded from a database she created with MySQL through pythonanywhere., web design; web development; pythonanywhere; MySQL; python, https://app.greenweb.org/api/v3/greencheckimage/lydiak22.pythonanywhere.com?nocache=true, https://github.com/lydsk22/PortfolioWebsite
Web Accessibility: Data Processing and Exploration, Jan-2025, The purpose of this project was to analyze the web accessibility errors present on the most commonly visited websites. In order to complete this project, a list of the top 1M most commonly visited websites was collected from Tranco (https://tranco-list.eu/list/24L29/full) then the top 100 websites (and eventually 36 more) were input into the WAVE API (https://wave.webaim.org/api/). The output from the WAVE API, a dataset including the webpage name, types of errors found on the page, the count of each type of error found on the page, etc., was further processed into clean usable data. Once this data was cleaned, data visualizations were made to better understand the data. This data exploration project was completed skills learned from Dr. Yu's Udemy Course, "100 Days of Python: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp," and the sofwares used were Pycharm and Google Colab., https://app.greenweb.org/api/v3/greencheckimage/lydiak22.pythonanywhere.com?nocache=true, https://github.com/lydsk22/WebAccessibility_DataAnalysis
