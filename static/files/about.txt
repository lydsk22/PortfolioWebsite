Lydia lives in Reston, VA with her husband and their cat. She's from the area but has lived all over Virginia: Blacksburg for college, Richmond fresh out of college, Portsmouth after that, and now back to Reston!\n
Having grown up in a house full of nerds (a term used lovingly), she has always had an interest in STEM. From cybersecurity club in high school, to majoring in Biological Systems Engineering in college,\n
to now learning web development, game design, and data analysis in her free time, STEM is pretty much her whole life (besides her cat). If she's ever not on her computer, she's probably volunteering with the Feline Foundation\n
of Greater Washington, cooking, or watching scary movies with her husband. In January 2025 she'll also start volunteering with Pet FBI and beginning her fellowship with Hiring our Heroes.\n

In college she discovered a passion for sustainability thanks to her academic advisor, Ms. Baker, suggesting she pick up a minor in green engineering. That, combined with her discovery of data analysis during her\n
time as a civil engineer at Timmons Group, has driven her to pursue a career in environmental data analysis. In order to achieve this she has spent months improving her coding and data analysis skills by taking classes\n
on Udemy and Linkedin Learning, as well as working with her career coach to obtain a Military Spouse Career Accelerator Pilot (MSCAP) fellowship with Hiring our Heroes and gain additional professional experience in the field.\n
