Hi! I'm Lydia, an environmental data analyst based in Reston, VA with my husband and our cat. I discovered my passion for data analysis
during my time at Timmons Group as a Project Engineer on the Economic Development team. That, combined with my B.S. in Biological Systems
Engineering from Virginia Tech (go hokies!), has lead me to pursue a career in environmental data analysis.

CHUNKMy husband and I moved to northern Virginia in August 2024, and since then I have been taking online courses on Udemy and Linkedin Learning
to develop my data analysis skills, participating in professional development opportunities as candidate for the Hiring Our Heroes Military Spouse Fellowship,
and volunteering with the Feline Foundation of Greater Washington and Pet FBI (Lost Cats Virginia), and exploring data through personal projects. Check
