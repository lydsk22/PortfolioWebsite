Lydia is an environmental data analyst who lives in Reston, VA with her husband and their cat. Having grown up in a house full of nerds (a term used lovingly), she has always had an interest in STEM but
her passion for sustainability wasn't discovered until college when her academic advisor suggested she pick up a minor in green engineering. That, combined with her introduction to data analysis during her
time as a civil engineer at Timmons Group, has driven her to pursue a career in environmental data analysis.

CHUNKShe has spent months improving her coding and data analysis skills by taking classes on Udemy and Linkedin Learning,
as well as working with her career coach to obtain a Military Spouse Career Accelerator Pilot (MSCAP) fellowship with Hiring our Heroes to gain additional professional experience in the field.

CHUNKIf she's ever not on her computer, she's probably volunteering with the Feline Foundation of Greater Washington, cooking and listening to Stephen King books on Audible, or watching movies with her husband.
In January 2025 she'll also start volunteering with Pet FBI and beginning her fellowship with Hiring our Heroes.
