Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm an environmental data analyst living in Reston, VA with my husband and our cat. I discovered my passion for data analysis
during my time at Timmons Group as a Project Engineer on the Economic Development team. That, combined with my B.S. in Biological Systems
Engineering from Virginia Tech (go hokies!), has lead me to pursue a career in environmental data analysis.

CHUNKMy husband and I moved to northern Virginia in August 2024, and I took that as an opportunity to pivot from civil engineering to data analysis.
Since then I have been taking online courses on Udemy and Linkedin Learning to develop my data analysis skills, participating as candidate in the
Hiring Our Heroes Military Spouse Career Accelerator Pilot (MSCAP) Fellowship, volunteering with the Feline Foundation of Greater Washington and Pet FBI,
and exploring data through personal projects. Speaking of my personal projects, check out my favorite projects below or look at them all on
