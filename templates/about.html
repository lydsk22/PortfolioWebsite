                        My husband and I moved to northern Virginia in August 2024, and I took that as an
                        opportunity to pivot from civil engineering to data analysis.
                        Since then, I have been taking online courses on Udemy and Linkedin Learning to develop
                        my data analysis skills, participating as candidate in the
                        Hiring Our Heroes Military Spouse Career Accelerator Pilot (MSCAP) Fellowship,
                        volunteering with the Feline Foundation of Greater Washington and Pet FBI,
                        and exploring data through personal projects.
                        P.S. This is my cat, Steve French, he's the best. He likes to help out when
                        I'm working.
